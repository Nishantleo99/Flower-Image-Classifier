# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The tech stack:
1. Python
2. PyTorch: For creating neural networks
3. Matplotlib: For visualizing the data from the model
4. torchvision: For loading the data

Note: The data is present inside the jupyter notebook in the form of a link.

Project provided by Udacity under the nanodegree: "AI Programming with Python".
